Summary: Some thoughts on pixel art

When it comes to drawing I’m no artist. Add some mathematics, then maybe just a little. Nothing is as beautiful as a pixel-perfectly drawn isometric 2.5D world.

Here’s something I put together from old graphics I still have lying around from plethora. (I didn’t draw all of it.) I hope it can encourage more people to try their hands in pixel art. If I can do it, I’m sure anyone can!
